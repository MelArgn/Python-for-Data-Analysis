# Python for Data Analysis
This is my repo for all my Python work. 

This repo consist of the following
 ### Project 1: Analysing Sales Data

 ### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze sales data to gain insights into sales performance across various dimensions, including sales amounts, product categories, and fulfillment methods. The analysis will address specific questions related to sales transactions and provide aggregated insights.
 ### Data Preparation
   + Data Cleaning: Removed rows with missing values, particularly focusing on the 'Amount' column to ensure accurate analysis.
   + Data Exploration: Conducted initial exploration to understand data structure and types, and to identify any anomalies or missing information.
 ### Deliverables
   + Average sales by category and status (Excel file report) 
   + Total sales by shipment and fulfillment type (Excel file report) 

 ### Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the sales performance across different dimensions. The findings can be used to inform strategic decisions related to inventory management, marketing, and sales strategies. Further analysis can be conducted to explore additional dimensions or trends over time.

## Project Title: E-commerce Data Analysis and Visualization

**Project Overview:**
This project involves analyzing and visualizing e-commerce data from multiple sources, including orders, payments, and customer information. The goal is to gain insights into payment patterns, customer behavior, and overall business performance.

**Data Sources:**
- Orders data (orders.xlsx)
- Payment data (order_payment.xlsx)
- Customer data (customers.xlsx)

**Data Preparation:**
1. Load data from Excel files using pandas
2. Handle missing values by filling with 'N/A' or dropping rows
3. Remove duplicate entries
4. Create subsets of data based on specific criteria (e.g., invoiced orders, credit card payments > 1000)
5. Merge datasets to create a comprehensive view of orders, payments, and customers

**Analysis and Visualization:**
1. Time-based analysis:
   - Create time-based columns (year, month, week)
   - Plot payment values over time

2. Payment analysis:
   - Scatter plot of payment values vs. installments by customer
   - Stacked bar chart of payment values by payment type and month
   - Box plot of payment value ranges by payment type

3. Combined visualization:
   - Create subplots combining box plot, stacked bar chart, and scatter plot for comprehensive view

**Key Findings:**
(Note: Specific findings would depend on the actual data analysis results)

**Recommendations:**
(Note: Recommendations would be based on the analysis findings)

**Next Steps:**
1. Perform more in-depth statistical analysis
2. Explore customer segmentation based on payment behavior
3. Investigate seasonal trends in sales and payments
4. Analyze the relationship between payment types and order values

**Technical Implementation:**
- Python libraries used: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- Data manipulation techniques: grouping, merging, filtering
- Visualization types: line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, box plots

This project demonstrates proficiency in data handling, analysis, and visualization using Python, providing valuable insights for e-commerce business decision-making.
